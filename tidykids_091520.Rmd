kids <- kids %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  filter(year != "1997")

# How complete is the data?
# Do all states have all the variables, and all the years of data? 

kids %>% 
  count(state, variable) %>% 
  arrange(n) 

# Each state has one observation per variable per year. Each state x variable has 20 observaitions except for the variables Medicaid_CHIP and other_health as their 1997 data was NA and removed. 

colSums(is.na(kids)) # No more missing data 
```

Where do overall states spend the most per child?
```{r}
kids %>% 
  group_by(variable) %>% 
  summarize(total = sum(inf_adj_perchild)) %>% 
  mutate(variable = fct_reorder(variable, total, .desc = F)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = variable, y = total)) +
  geom_col() + 
  theme_classic() + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", hjust = 0.5),
        axis.text.x = element_text(color = "black", angle = 90)) +
  labs(x = "Spending Sector", 
       y = "Total Adjusted Spending / Child") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar) +
  coord_flip()

```

Let's focus on the health related spending of the states for the top states that spend heavily on health related spending:
```{r}
kids %>% 
  filter(state %in% c("District of Columbia", "New York", "Wyoming", "Massachusetts", "Vermont", "New Mexico", "Mississippi", "California", "Maine", "Oregon"),
         variable %in% c("other_health", "Medicaid_CHIP", "pubhealth")) %>%
  group_by(state, year) %>% 
  summarize(total = sum(inf_adj_perchild)) %>%
  mutate(change = total / dplyr::first(total) - 1) %>%
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(state = fct_reorder(state, change)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = change)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~state, ncol = 5) + 
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
  theme_classic() 
```

Change in public health spending over time using some newly learned tidy features (from Dan Robinson's screen cast):  
```{r}
# General trends in public health spending 
kids %>% 
  filter(variable == "pubhealth", 
         state %in% sample(unique(state),51)) %>% 
  mutate(state = fct_reorder(state, inf_adj_perchild, max, .desc = TRUE)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(year, inf_adj_perchild)) +
  geom_line() +
  expand_limits(y = 0) + #Sets the y-axis scale to start from 0
  facet_wrap(~state) +
  theme_tufte() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) +
  labs(title = "Statewise spending per child on public health", y = "Inflation adjusted spending per child in $1000s", x = "Year") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar) # Adds symbols to axis labels 

# Change in public health spending over the years 
kids %>% 
  filter(variable == "pubhealth",
         state %in% sample(unique(state),51))  %>% 
  mutate(change = inf_adj_perchild / first(inf_adj_perchild) - 1) %>% 
  mutate(state = fct_reorder(state, change, max, .desc = TRUE)) %>% 
   ggplot(aes(year, inf_adj_perchild)) +
  geom_line() +
  expand_limits(y = 0) + #Sets the y-axis scale to start from 0
  facet_wrap(~state) +
  theme_tufte() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90), plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold")) +
  labs(title = "Statewise spending per child on public health", y = "Change in inflation adjusted spending per child in $1000s", x = "Year") + 
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent, breaks = c(0,2,4,6))
  
  
```

Key takeaways:
DC has some of the highest spending on public health which seems to have been cut down since 2009. Vermont has an increased spending in public health, whereas most other states don't see much of a growth.


I would like to improve this visualization using the top public health spenders (as opposed to the current random sample in the visualization) as well as look at the proportion of total spending that states spend on public health infrastructure. When I have time again!
